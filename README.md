### What it does
- Displays news headlines from sources like The Hindu, Indian Express, CNBC, BBC, Al Jazeera, and more
- Clean and responsive card-based UI
- Categorized tabs (All News, India, India Finance, World, Global Finance)
- Shows publish date and time for each article
- No backend or database â€” all logic handled on the frontend using vanilla JavaScript

### How it works
- Uses public RSS feed URLs from news websites
- Converts RSS to JSON using the rss2json.com API
- Parses and displays news on cards using plain JavaScript
- All files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are static and hosted via GitHub Pages

### How to run locally
1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/annita65/clean-news.git`

### Customize or Add Sources

### Current known issues
- Some sources like LiveMint and Business Standard show outdated or no data due to their RSS feed restrictions.
- Actively looking for alternative reliable free feeds.
